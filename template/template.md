# Open Source Game Clones
This site tries to gather [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) reimplementations of great old games in one place. If you think that something is missing from the list - please go to our [Github repository](http://github.com/piranha/osgameclones/) and create an issue or even a pull request!

Since all these projects are open-source you can help them and make this world a better place. Or at least you can play something to appreciate the effort people put in them.
